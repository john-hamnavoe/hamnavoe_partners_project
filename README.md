# README

Basic tool to help manage a consultancy project I am currently working on, I have a set of issues that need to be managed. 

They need to be reconcilled to a set of tickets, need to keep notes on the issues, and record timesheets. 

Maybe not much use outwith the project I am working on, however some things that might be of interest in this project for others:

  * Import issues and tickets from spreadsheets.

  * Nested form for time sheet entry.

  * Stimulus Reflex Searching and Paging

  * Tailwind CSS

  * Devise

  * Stimulus Reflex inplace updates

  * Stimulus Reflex ticket search

Stimulus Reflex functionality mostly based on excellent [stimulus reflex expo](https://expo.stimulusreflex.com/)

Nested form based on [go rails screencast](https://gorails.com/episodes/dynamic-nested-forms-with-stimulus-js)
